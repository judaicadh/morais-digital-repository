### Sabato Morais Digital Repository. 

This is the code for the [Sabato Morais Digital Repository](https://morais.exhibits.library.upenn.edu/). It uses a modified version of [collectionbuilder-gh](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-gh), which is for use with compound objects, i.e. where a record has more than one image. [collectionbuilder-gh](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-gh) is a Jekyll project to create a digital collection exhibit using GitHub pages given a CSV of collection metadata and a folder of JPEG images or PDF documents. 

More on this project can be found at [judaicadh.github.io](https://judaicadh.github.io/work/morais-repository/)
