This phase of the Sabato Morais Digitization Project could not have gotten off the ground without a generous start-up gift from Marvin and Sybil Weiner and from their son and daughter-in-law, Herbert and Sheila Weiner. The Sabato Morais Digitization Project was completed thanks to two major, matching gifts from the Jesselson and Kaplan Family Foundations. 

This project would not be possible without the assistance of the following:

Mary Ellen Burd, Director of Strategic Communications
Chandra Collins, Imaging Specialist
Doug Emery, Special Collections Digital Content Programmer
Jesselson Family Foundation
Michael Jesselson
Michael Kanning, Senior Developer
Kaplan Family Foundation
Arnold and Deanne Kaplan

Emily Morton Owens, Assistant University Librarian, Digital Library Development & Systems

Heather Newlin, Cataloguer and Transcriber
Michael Overgaard, Project Manager and TEI Encoder
