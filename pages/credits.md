This phase of the Sabato Morais Digitization Project could not have gotten off the ground without a generous start-up gift from Marvin and Sybil Weiner and from their son and daughter-in-law, Herbert and Sheila Weiner. The Sabato Morais Digitization Project was completed thanks to two major, matching gifts from the Jesselson and Kaplan Family Foundations. 

This project would not be possible without the assistance of the following:

* Mary Ellen Burd, Director of Strategic Communications
* Chandra Collins, Imaging Specialist
* Doug Emery, Special Collections Digital Content Programmer
* Jesselson Family Foundation
* Michael Jesselson
* Michael Kanning, Senior Developer
* Kaplan Family Foundation

## Related Initiatives 

The [Jesselson-Kaplan American Genizah Project]({{ site. url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/about-american-genizah.html) is an international initiative to integrate digital technologies into the way we study early American Jewry. Its primary goal is to create an open access digital repository or “genizah” of physically dispersed primary sources that document the development of Jewish life in the western hemisphere from the 16th-19th centuries. More information can be found [here](/about-american-genizah.html). 

Our third [Jesselson-Kaplan American Genizah Project](https://morais.exhibits.library.upenn.edu/jesselson-kaplan-american-genizah-project), [The Sabato Morais Digitization Project]({{ site. url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/about-sabato-morais-digitization-project.html), provides digital access to the writings and correspondence of Sabato Morais.  His personal papers and publications, in turn, point researchers to primary sources that document the development of observant Jewish life in the broad context of Victorian culture on both sides of the Atlantic during the nineteenth century. (More about Morais can be found here.) This project is of interest to scholars of American, Italian and Sephardic Jewish history, religious studies, immigration and ethnic studies, Hebrew language and the history of Biblical interpretation, and the history of scholarship. By making these writings and correspondence of Sabato Morais digitally available, researchers have access to primary sources that document the development of observant Jewish life in the broad context of Victorian culture on both sides of the Atlantic during the nineteenth century.
