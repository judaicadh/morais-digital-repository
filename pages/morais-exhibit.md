Sabato Morais (1823-1897) was the spiritual leader of Philadelphia's Spanish and Portuguese Congregation Mikveh Israel from 1851 until his death in 1897.  To many in his community, the Italian-born Morais epitomized the idealized qualities of a sage: piety, humility and wisdom.  A cultured scholar, a lover of music and a composer of poetry, Morais was also a teacher, communal leader and public speaker fully engaged with the burning issues of his day.  He represented a new and yet ancient type in the history of Jewish leaders.  Dressed in the garb of the modern clergyman, Morais also strictly observed traditional Jewish customs and practices.  Paradoxically, Morais appeared to his co-religionists as a role model at a time when the communal roles he performed as a ministering rabbi and volunteer worker were serving less and less as ideals for imitation.  The status and authority of the "rabbi" and traditional religion itself were being turned upside down and devalued by the transformative forces of political emancipation, industrialization and professionalization.

Morais lived in many worlds.  He was an Italian patriot, an observant Jew and a proud American citizen.  He regularly represented the Jews of Philadelphia to the non-Jewish community.  He published articles in the Jewish and general press and lectured publicly before a wide variety of audiences.  He fought social and economic injustice, religious intolerance and racial oppression, opposing both the evil institution of slavery and restrictive immigration laws directed against the Chinese.  He was the first traditional American Jewish leader to support women's right to vote on congregational matters.  Above all, Morais devoted his life to teaching.  He taught at the Hebrew Sunday School, the Hebrew Education Society, the Jewish Foster Home, and privately tutored young people for free.  He served as professor of Bible and Homiletics at Maimonides College, the first American rabbinical seminary, which existed in Philadelphia from 1867 until 1873. Morais served as an examiner at the Hebrew Union College founded in 1875 by leaders of the American Jewish Reform movement.  Unable to find common ground, he broke with the Reformers during the 1880s and founded the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York City in 1886 to train a new generation of traditional rabbis. 

Morais' death on Thursday, November 11, 1897 [17 Marheshvan 5658] resulted in an unprecedented outpouring of grief.  The thousands that lined the streets the following Monday turned his burial into the first mass public funeral in American Jewish history.  Shortly after his death, he was memorialized as "*der grester fun ale ortodoksishe rabonim in Amerike ... on sofek*" [" without doubt ... the greatest of all Orthodox rabbis in America"].

> "With my mind's eye I see him standing upon the Bema [*Teba*] of his congregation's synagog [sic] located on Seventh street, north of Arch ... He was about 5 ft. 10 in. in height, had silken hair with tender curls, deep-set dark eyes, a greyish beard and possessed a sonorous, penetrating but well-modulated voice.  He was attired with high silk hat, black gown and talith whenever he performed the duties of reader and preacher."

Formative Experiences in Italy and England
==========================================

Sabato Morais was born in Livorno, an Italian port city south of Pisa, on April 13, 1823 [2 Iyar 5583].  Morais was raised in "humble circumstances."  He was the third of nine children -- one younger brother and seven sisters.  His father Samuel Morais descended from Portuguese Conversos, Jews who outwardly passed as Christians while secretly maintaining their Jewish identity. Morais' mother, Buonina Wolf, and her family came from southern Germany. Morais, thus, was genealogically both a Sephardi and an Ashkenazi, but grew up praying according to the Sephardic liturgical rite. 

### Jewish Education in Livorno

Views of the Main Synagogue at Livorno

Livorno, or Leghorn as English sailors called it, was home to one of Europe's most vibrant Jewish communities.   Famous for its distinguished tradition of rabbinic scholarship and Hebrew printing, the Jewish community's main synagogue pictured here was once described as second only to that of Amsterdam in grandeur and beauty.   The synagogue was turned into a barracks by the Austrian imperial forces who entered Livorno during the Revolution of 1848.  During the Second World War, the synagogue was sacked and completely destroyed by bombings.

A new type of Jewish educational institution opened in Livorno in 1832, just as Morais turned nine years-old, under the auspices of a city-wide merchant reform program.  In his history of the Jews of Livorno, Morais described the new type of educational program, which provided students with practical and religious instruction: 

> *"Highest among the high [of Livorno's Jewish institutions] stands the educational institute ... scores of infants under the superintendence of well-trained female teachers acquire rudimental knowledge and are promoted from grade to grade, always joining secular to religious studies, so that while, to a male child, that institution affords the means of becoming a bookkeeper, a mechanic, or a Rabbi, to a girl it offers the facilities of gaining accomplishments fitting her for the parlor not less than for the kitchen." *

Ordination Certificate

*Library at the Herbert D. Katz Center for Advanced Judaic Studies, University of Pennsylvania*

Morais was tutored in general studies by Salvatore di Benedetti of the University of Pisa and received rabbinical training in Livorno.  This ordination certificate, signed by Livorno's chief rabbi Hakham Abraham Barukh Piperno, conferred on Morais the title "*maskil*," indicating he was qualified to teach Jewish subjects, but ranked him below "*hakham*," the highest honorific in the Sephardic tradition, reserved for rabbinic authorities.  In 1887, the University of Pennsylvania awarded Morais an honorary doctorate of laws, hence his being called in later years, the Reverend Doctor Morais.

Ordination Essay

*Library at the Herbert D. Katz Center for Advanced Judaic Studies, University of Pennsylvania*

Morais titled his ordination essay "*Tekhunat he-hakham*" [Character (or Qualities) of the Sage].  The essay is written in the ornate rhetorical style of rabbinic prose called "*melitsah*," in which Biblical verses are creatively woven together to form new sentences.  The epigraph is taken from an early rabbinic collection of ethical aphorisms found in the *Mishnah*, *Seder Nezikin*, called *Pirke Avot* (Sayings of the Fathers) [I.17]: "*Lo ha-midrash hu ha-'ikar, ela ha-ma'aseh" -- *"Action, not talk is the main thing."

Freemasonry Certificate

*[Sunday], August 30, 1846. Library at the Herbert D. Katz Center for Advanced Judaic Studies, University of Pennsylvania*

Many Italian Jews belonged to secret fraternal orders such as the Freemasons, a brotherhood founded in England in the eighteenth century on universalist principles and religious tolerance.  In the aftermath of the French Revolution, Italian Freemasons supported the Risorgimento, the movement to create a united Italian republic free of the yoke of Austrian imperialism.  Morais, imbued from childhood with the ideals of Republican government, joined the Freemasons, following in the footsteps of both his grandfather as well as his father, who once suffered imprisonment for his political views.

### Moving to London

Morais, age twenty-two, left Livorno for London in 1845 to apply for a position at the city's leading Spanish and Portuguese congregation, Sha'ar Shamayim, at Bevis Marks. Despite his warm reception, he did not win the position, principally because of his unpolished English. Within a year, however, Morais was invited back to head the congregation's orphanage. He worked there from 1846 until 1851.

Resolution, London Jewish Orphan Home

*Library at the Herbert D. Katz Center for Advanced Judaic Studies, University of Pennsylvania*

This resolution of thanks, adopted at a general meeting, was copied and sent to Morais in October of 1847, after his first year of service there. Morais held the position of "Master" of the Orphan Home and taught at the school.

In London, Morais was befriended by a number of powerful and influential figures, including the Jewish philanthropist Moses Montefiore, a native of Livorno, and the exiled leader of Italian nationalism, Giuseppe Mazzini.  Morais is said to have given his passport to Mazzini to enable him to return in secret to Italy and plot the overthrow of Austrian imperial domination.

The American Jewish Ministry in the Nineteenth Century
Before Jews became citizens of nation-states, rabbis primarily functioned within autonomous Jewish communities as judges, legal authorities and as heads of rabbinical academies (yeshivot).  Rabbis did not personally attend to the day-to-day affairs of their communities.   The political emancipation of the Jews resulted in the collapse of the structures of Jewish self-government and undermined the rabbi's status and authority.  In the United States in the nineteenth-century, rabbis served a largely symbolic and ceremonial purpose.  As the name suggests, Jewish "ministers," functioned as a kind of  imitation of Protestant clergy.  They worked at the behest and in the pay of the laity.  American Jewish ministers often lacked any formal credentials or specialized training.  For many who called themselves "rabbi," the sole claim to the title was the ability to read from the Torah scroll, chant the Hebrew prayers and some advanced education in Europe.   Despite his rabbinical training, Morais on principle resisted all titles, including "rabbi."

Morais first arrived in America in the spring of 1851 to apply for the post of "Hazan and Lecturer," the reader and minister, at Philadelphia's Spanish and Portuguese Mikveh Israel congregation, located at Cherry Street.   On April 13, 1851 Morais was elected on the sixth ballot in a closely contested election.  He served at Mikveh Israel until his death in November of 1897. His duties included leading the prayer services, preaching a Sabbath sermon in English explaining the weekly Bible reading, teaching children, and officiating at weddings and funerals.  He also published articles in the Jewish and general press and lectured publicly before a wide variety of audiences and associations. 

Morais' forty-six years at Mikveh Israel amounted to the longest continuous American Jewish ministry in the nineteenth century. Depicted here is the synagogue at 7th and Arch streets, consecrated in 1860, where Morais spent the majority of his ministry.


Prayerbook

Seder Tefilot (Florence, 1715). View this item.

Changing the prayer service became a matter of great controversy in America, dividing reformers from traditionalists.  Some proposed abbreviating the Hebrew prayers and introducing the English vernacular into the service.  Despite opposing the idea of liturgical reform, Morais considered accommodating those clamoring for change, but only if, he said, it would strengthen Judaism  in America.  This is the title page of the edition of a prayer book according to the Sephardic liturgical rite, printed in Florence in 1715. As the inscription on a copy held at the LIbrary of the Jewish Theological Seminary tells, Judah Hackenburg, a board member at Mikveh Israel, bequeathed this traditional prayer book, to Morais in 1862.


The Hebrew Language and Prayer

Sabato Morais, A Discourse Delivered on Sabbath Bemidbar, Sivan the 2nd 5652 (May 28, 1892) It Being the Thirty-Second Anniversary of the Consecration of the Synagogue , On Seventh Street Above Arch (Philadelphia, n.p., 1892), p. 6. Library at the Herbert D. Katz Center for Advanced Judaic Studies, University of Pennsylvania. View this item. 

"The Hebrew language is very dear to me.  I have made it my cherished study from childhood to old age.  In it my mother delighted to hear her boy chant benedictions and hymns.  It has proved moreover a solace to my heart in many a vicissitude."
Writing
In addition to delivering a sabbath sermon almost every week for forty-six years, he published hundreds of articles in the newspapers of his day on a wide variety of topics, religious and secular, including capital punishment, cruelty to children and animals, humanitarian causes, and other political matters.  Morais remained outspoken in his views even though he risked on occasion his livelihood by provoking his congregants.

Sabato Morais, Italian Hebrew Literature

Julius H. Greenstone (New York: The Jewish Theological Seminary of America, 1926). Library at the Herbert D. Katz Center for Advanced Judaic Studies, University of Pennsylvania.

Appearing posthumously, Italian Hebrew Literature is the only published collection of Morais' writings.  During his lifetime, Morais' writings appeared as newspaper articles or in pamphlet form, usually reprinted from oral addresses primarily directed at a popular audience.  Nonetheless, his deep familiarity with the Italian Jewish intellectual tradition is well-represented here.  Morais discusses, among others, the Jewish "Dante," Immanuel of Rome, the Italian Jewish humanist, Azariah de' Rossi, and Samuel David Luzzatto, of Trieste, a reknowned Biblical exegete.

Contract of Employment

Congregation Mikveh Israel and Sabato Morais, 1851-54; renewals through 1863. Congregation Mikveh Israel.

Morais' ministerial duties, subject to the review of the congregation's board, included leading the prayer services in Hebrew, preaching a Sabbath sermon in English, teaching and lecturing, and officiating at weddings, funerals and other life-cycle and holiday events.  His initial salary was $1,300 per year, paid quarterly and to rise to $1,700 in the event of marriage.  Four years later, on March 11, 1855, Morais married Clara Esther Weil, a school teacher he met at the Hebrew Sunday School.  They had seven children, Nina, Esther, Rebecca, Henry, Gentile, Miriam and Leon, before her death in 1872.

Threats During the Civil War

During the Civil War, Morais endured a three-month gag order. Several board members objected to his outspoken support for Abraham Lincoln and the Union cause. Lincoln embodied the Republican principles of liberty and fraternalism so dear to Morais, while a number of his congregants were Copperheads, northern sympathizers with southern secessionists. The Union League of Philadelphia later elected Morais to its clergy rolls, akin to an honorary membership, for his role during the bloodiest war in American history.

"Copperheads became so enraged by reason of [the Thanksgiving address Morais delivered in 1864] that I got a hornets' nest 'round my ears.  Men draped in brief authority would have stopped my speaking altogether, but I appeared to my constituents, and after three months' silence resumed my free speech as formerly."
Hebrew Eulogy for Abraham Lincoln

Sabato Morais [n.d.; written after April 14, 1865]. Reproduction, American Jewish Historical Society.

This eulogy, written by Isaac Goldstein, in rhyming Hebrew for President Abraham Lincoln who was assassinated during the intermediate days of Passover in the Spring of 1865.  The poem is written in the form of an acrostic with the initial Hebrew letter of each line spelling out the name "Abraham Lincoln."   It consists of 3 stanzas of four rhyming lines, with the non-rhyming fifth line after the first stanza perhaps serving as a refrain during oral recital.  Lincoln is praised for redeeming the "people of Cush," (African-Americans) from slavery, and wishes for Lincoln eternal glory for the courageous battle he waged for freedom.  A copy of this poem in Morais' hand is held in at the American Jewish Historical Society.

Translation

"My heart overflows with gracious words, I address my poem to a king" [Psalm 45:2]

Blessed are you Lincoln, who is like you/

Among kings and princes you are truly exalted/

You acted greatly with a humble soul/

You are considered unique throughout the land/

Who among rulers is like Lincoln? and who is to be praised like him?/

You have a name among the brave/

Your right hand filled with valor/

Against them you girded the sword of carnage/

Your bow day and night you drew/

"One father created us" you said/

Therefore, Liberty, you proclaimed as your command/

The people of Cush you led to freedom/

May they praise and bless your name forever.

Upon learning of the death of Abraham Lincoln, Mikveh Israel resolved to drape the synagogue in black for a month and hold a special memorial service. Morais delivered this sermon on Wednesday, April 19, 1865 on that occasion, the day after Passover, and a second sermon on June 1, 1865, a national day of fasting held on the second day of the Jewish festival of Shavu'ot (Pentecost). On each occasion, a grief-stricken Morais mourned the nation's loss against the background of Jewish holiday events otherwise celebrated as times for rejoicing.

Communal Work
=============

Morais lived in many worlds.  He regularly represented the Jews of Philadelphia to the larger gentile community.  He protested President Buchanan's indifference to the Mortara Affair, and he defended the interests of Jews around the world.  At great personal risk he fought the evils of slavery and pledged support for Lincolon and the Union cause.

In June of 1858 an almost seven year-old Jewish child named Edgardo Mortara, who had been secretly baptised as an infant by a young Catholic maid working in the family's employ, was taken by gendarmes from his home in Bologna to Rome to be raised as a convert to Christianity.  When President James Buchanan failed to respond to the Vatican's refusal to condemn the abduction, and his own congregation did not join a planned city-wide protest, Morais refused to recite the regular prayer for the welfare of the U.S. government.  For his insubordination, he was warned, the Board "can suspend you from office, which would be only a step to discharge...."

Morais participated in a large number of educational and charitable projects sponsored by Philadelphia's Jewish women leaders and their organizations, such as the Female Hebrew Benevolent Society, founded in 1819.  The society's annual meetings were regularly held in Mikveh Israel's congregation chambers.  During the 1880s and the onset of mass migration, Morais persuaded the society to allocate a portion of their funds to support the Port Richmond Industrial school in northeast Philadelphia.  The school, located in the heart of little "Jerusalem," provided vocational training to new immigrants.

Circular, Hebrew Literary Association

*December 15, 1873. Library at the Herbert D. Katz Center for Advanced Judaic Studies, University of Pennsylvania*

Literary associations flourished within the cultural setting of Victorian Philadelphia.  The Hebrew Literary Association, founded in 1873 and the Young Men's Hebrew Association, patterned after it, which opened two years later in 1875, provided a forum for Morais to lecture about Jewish history, religion and culture.  The stated object was to "gain an insight into the Jewish learning of the past" and be open to all subjects that "may expand the range of human thought, and impart a knowledge of what is good and useful."  This circular announces plans to establish the Association as well as Morais' endorsement.

Education and Religious Schism
==============================

Over the decades, Morais' duties expanded to meet the increasing needs of the city's rapidly expanding Jewish population.  He oversaw the Congregation's school system.  He was the first traditional American Jewish leader to support women's right to vote on congregational matters and regularly worked with the leading Jewish women of his city on communal projects, especially working among the immigrant poor.  Morais played a central, often daily role as a teacher at the Hebrew Sunday School, the Hebrew Education Society, the Jewish Foster Home, the Mikveh Israel Congregational school, and as a founder of Maimonides College in Philadelphia.  He served as professor of Bible and Homiletics from 1867 until the College's demise in 1873.  After breaking with the American Jewish Reform movement during the 1880s, Morais founded the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York City in 1886 to train a new generation of traditional rabbis.  He called the seminary his "Benjamin," the child of his old age.  He also taught there and served as the institution's president until his death in 1897.

Letter from Lipman, L. to Morais, Sabato. Cincinnati, OH; Jul 1877

*Library at the Herbert D. Katz Center for Advanced Judaic Studies, University of Pennsylvania* 

The Hebrew Union College was founded in Cincinnati in 1875 by Isaac Mayer Wise and others to train American rabbis.  This letter shows that Morais served as an examiner at the College during its early years of existence.  After hearing that (non-kosher) shellfish had been served at the gala dinner of the first graduating class in 1883, the so-called "*Treyfa* Banquet," [*treyfa* refers to ritually unacceptable food],  Morais broke with the college, which later became the institutional center of Reform Judaism in America.

Morais was the principal founder of the early Jewish Theological Seminary.  This circular documents Morais' authorship of the idea for a Seminary to train American rabbis committed to traditional principles, as well as its motto: "*lilmod u-lelamed, lishmor ve-la'asot* -- "To Learn and to Teach, To Observe, and To Practice."  On his seventieth birthday in 1893, his students proclaimed: "To your efforts and your efforts alone is due the establishment and direction of our Alma Mater, founded to carry into effect the Jewish ideals you have ever championed."   Morais called the Seminary his "Benjamin," the child of his old age.  He also taught Bible there and served as president until his death in 1897.

The Immigrant Community
=======================

Morais opposed social and economic injustice, racial oppression and religious intolerance.  He was an outspoken critic of the Chinese exclusion laws in the 1880s.  Morais also played an important role helping to settle the flood of immigrants who arrived in Philadelphia beginning in the 1880s.

Letter, The Chevalier Emanuel Veneziani to Sabato Morais

*Emanuel Veneziani, September 5, 1888. Library at the Herbert D. Katz Center for Advanced Judaic Studies, University of Pennsylvania.*

Morais played an important role, as a fund-raiser and as a social worker, helping to settle thousands of eastern European Jewish immigrants in the United States in the last quarter of the nineteenth century.  This letter in French, from Morais' childhood friend Emanuel Veneziani, the almoner (distributer of funds) for the Baron Maurice de Hirsch, pledges $5,000 to Morais for the Carmel Colony agricultural settlement in southern New Jersey.  The Baron de Hirsch Fund financially supported vocational schools and agricultural projects designed to train Jewish immigrants for new kinds of productive labor.

Plea for the end of "Der Groyser Klokmakher Strayk" (The Great Cloakmaker's Strike of 1890):

*Sabato Morais, Philadelphia Jewish Exponent, August 15, 1890.*

When a volatile labor dispute erupted in 1890, pitting some of his own wealthy congregants against the garment workers and their newly formed union, Morais played a central role mediating a bitter strike which lasted throughout the summer.  Morais made such an impression on the strikers that in deference to him the Anarchist leaders among them called off their annual "Yom Kippur ball," a defiantly secular feast staged on the holiest fast day of the Jewish calendar.

> "I implore of you, brethren, to arrive at a conciliatory conclusion ... Deliver [the strikers] from starvation and death by a return to the work which will gain for you a livelihood, and the approval of all the right-thinking among the community of Philadelphia."

When Morais died on November 11, 1897, the outpouring of grief was unprecedented.  Morais left explicit instructions to avoid all ostentation at his funeral and to deliver no eulogies at his service.  Despite his wishes, thousands of people from all walks of life, Jews and non-Jews, women and men, young and old, stood for hours in the rain the following Monday to witness the funeral procession pass from his home near Fifth and Green Streets in North Philadelphia to the congregation's cemetery at 11th and Federal Streets in the heart of the immigrant quarter of South Philadelphia.  The throngs of people turned the occasion into the first mass, public  funeral in American Jewish history. 

> "Men, women and children from the Russian quarter [in South Philadelphia] had gathered....  Masses of  these people lined the adjoining streets and  waited patiently for the funeral to arrive ... there they stood, women holding their children by the hand and babies in their arms -- men with grey hair and others in the prime of life-- a quiet, sad tearful assemblage, waiting for *their* dead.  It was a crowd such as follows a departing hero on his way to battle for their cause, except they were subdued and overawed by the magnitude of their grief...."

Conclusion
==========

Morais was a man of selfless service and faithful piety who defended what he understood to be the best of Judaism's traditions.  He was absolutely dogmatic in his belief in God and in the eternality of God's commandments.  He was also absolutely determined to accommodate changing circumstance if he felt he could strengthen Judaism and its adherents.  Despite much personal pain, including the tragic loss of his wife in 1872, leaving him with seven young children to raise, he never gave in to despair.  By the time of his death, Morais had emerged as the outstanding representative of traditional Judaism in the United States in the nineteenth century.  For many of the thousands of Yiddish-speaking immigrants, radicals and religious alike, who turned out for his funeral a century ago, he was also the most beloved.
